Welcome to Watering The Garden! 

Today we're going to put all of our skills we've been practicing to make a cute little website! At the beginning of class, i'll give us a prompt/theme and you can use that to build a website or do whatever the heck you want! 

No criteria to meet. No requirements. Pssttt... Hey! Guess what 😏 ..... It's also NOT A competition, babes. All you gotta do is have fun with the garden you make today!!! 

Pair up. Go Solo. Whatever you'd like! 

You have one hour to give me something fierce and something Y O U! 

Cheers everyone and have fun!
